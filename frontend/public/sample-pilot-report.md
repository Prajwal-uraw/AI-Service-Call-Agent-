# KestrelVoice Production Pilot
## Revenue Opportunity & Call Leakage Analysis

**Confidential Report Prepared For:** Comfort Pro HVAC  
**Pilot Period:** June 15-21, 2024 (7 Days)  
**Pilot Reference ID:** KV-PILOT-2024-0615  
**Report Generated:** June 22, 2024

## Executive Summary — Observed Performance & Modeled Opportunity

This report summarizes the observed performance of the **KestrelVoice Autonomous Call Handling Platform** during your 7-day production pilot on a live business phone line.

The analysis translates actual call data observed during the pilot into a **conservative, directional revenue opportunity model**, designed to support an informed deployment decision.

### Key Finding (Pilot-Based)

Based on observed call patterns during the pilot period, your business exhibits a **material revenue opportunity** currently exposed to call handling limitations, particularly during peak hours and after-hours.

Using conservative assumptions and industry benchmarks, full deployment is positioned to recover a meaningful portion of this opportunity.

> **Important:** All revenue figures beyond the pilot window are modeled projections based on observed data, customer-provided averages, and conservative benchmarks. Actual results depend on seasonality, staffing, pricing, and operational execution.

## Section 1 — Call Leakage & Capacity Analysis

### 1.1 Peak-Hour Call Capacity

**Observed Pattern**  
During peak business hours (8:00 AM – 12:00 PM), inbound call volume reached **24 calls per hour** on Tuesday and Thursday.

**Industry Context**  
HVAC businesses relying on manual dispatch or overflow call centers typically miss **25–35% of calls** during these windows due to:

- Busy lines and call queue abandonment
- Dispatcher overload during simultaneous calls
- Staff unavailability during service runs
- Lunch breaks and shift changes

**Modeled Exposure (Directional)**  
Using observed pilot volume and conservative miss-rate assumptions:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Modeled Missed Calls** | 38 per week |
| **Modeled Annual Exposure** | 1,976 calls |
| **Value at Risk (Avg. Ticket: $550)** | **$1,086,800 annually** |

*Based on 30% miss rate during peak hours without autonomous coverage*

### 1.2 After-Hours & Emergency Call Handling

**Observed During Pilot**

- Calls handled outside standard business hours: **23**
- All pilot-period after-hours calls were answered live
- Average after-hours call handling time: **3.1 minutes**

**Industry Context**  
Across HVAC operators, **~60% of after-hours calls** route to voicemail or go unanswered, particularly emergency requests.

**Intent Signals Observed**  
14 calls contained high-urgency language such as:

- "No cooling" (8 calls)
- "Emergency" (4 calls)
- "Water leak" (2 calls)
- "Burning smell" (1 call)

**Modeled Opportunity (Directional)**  
Capturing these calls consistently is positioned to materially increase emergency service revenue, particularly during peak seasons.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **After-Hours Calls (Weekly Average)** | 23 |
| **Annualized After-Hours Volume** | 1,196 calls |
| **Current Capture Rate (Estimated)** | 40% |
| **Missed After-Hours Calls** | 718 annually |
| **Value at Risk (Avg. Ticket: $650)** | **$466,700 annually** |

*Emergency calls typically command 15-20% premium pricing*

## Section 2 — Qualification & Operational Efficiency

### 2.1 Call Qualification Quality

During the pilot:

✅ **100% of calls** captured structured intent data  
✅ Service type, urgency, and contact details were recorded  
✅ Calls were pre-qualified against service rules before booking  
✅ **89 high-intent calls** (70%) identified and prioritized  

**Data Captured Per Call:**
- Customer name and contact information
- Service type (repair, maintenance, installation, emergency)
- Equipment details (brand, model, age when provided)
- Urgency level (routine, priority, emergency)
- Preferred appointment windows
- Property type (residential, commercial)

**Operational Impact**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Estimated dispatcher/admin time automated** | 9.5 hours |
| **Manual data entry eliminated** | 127 call records |
| **Callback attempts avoided** | 34 (direct bookings) |
| **Average time saved per call** | 4.5 minutes |

### 2.2 Booking Velocity & Conversion

**Observed Performance**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average call-to-booking time** | 2.3 minutes |
| **Booking conversion rate** | 38% (34 of 89 qualified calls) |
| **Same-day bookings** | 12 (35% of bookings) |
| **Next-day bookings** | 18 (53% of bookings) |

**Comparison**  
Manual follow-up processes often introduce **24–48 hour delays**, where conversion rates decline significantly:

- Industry average callback conversion: **18-22%**
- KestrelVoice live booking conversion: **38%**
- **Conversion lift: +73% to +111%**

**Operational Implication**  
Faster booking materially improves close rates on high-intent service calls. Every hour of delay reduces conversion probability by approximately 8-12%.

### 2.3 Call Intelligence & Routing

**Smart Routing Decisions Made:**

- **Emergency escalations:** 14 calls routed to on-call technician
- **Warranty inquiries:** 8 calls flagged for follow-up
- **Commercial leads:** 6 calls marked for sales team
- **Repeat customers:** 19 calls identified and prioritized

**Quality Metrics:**

- **Call accuracy rate:** 96% (customer-verified)
- **Booking accuracy:** 100% (no scheduling conflicts)
- **Customer satisfaction:** 4.7/5.0 (post-call survey)
