## 🔄 Additional Engines (Nice to Have, Not Critical)

These would enhance the report but are **not required** for a valuable pilot report:

### **7. Call Qualification Engine** (Medium Priority)
**What it adds:** Structured data extraction (customer info, equipment details)
**Impact:** More detailed qualification section
**Status:** Can be added later

### **8. Peak Hour Analysis Engine** (Medium Priority)
**What it adds:** Hourly call distribution charts
**Impact:** Visual insights into call patterns
**Status:** Can derive from capacity engine data

### **9. After-Hours Tracking Engine** (Medium Priority)
**What it adds:** Detailed after-hours breakdown
**Impact:** Separate after-hours opportunity section
**Status:** Can derive from call timestamps

### **10. Booking Velocity Engine** (Low Priority)
**What it adds:** Time-to-booking metrics
**Impact:** Additional efficiency metric
**Status:** Nice to have, not critical

## 📊 Current Report Generation Flow

```
1. COLLECT PILOT DATA
   ├─ Call logs from Daily.co
   ├─ Transcripts from Deepgram
   ├─ Bookings from ServiceTitan
   └─ Customer baseline (intake form)

2. RUN ENGINES
   ├─ Baseline Engine → Create baseline + comparisons
   ├─ Assumptions Engine → Load assumption set v1.0
   ├─ Call Intent Engine → Classify all calls
   ├─ Capacity Engine → Analyze saturation
   ├─ Latency Engine → Calculate performance
   └─ Metric Engine → Tag all metrics

3. GENERATE REPORT SECTIONS
   ├─ Executive Summary (baseline + metrics)
   ├─ Pilot Snapshot (8 key metrics)
   ├─ Call Leakage (capacity + assumptions)
   ├─ Qualification (intent classification)
   ├─ Financial Model (assumptions + modeling)
   ├─ Technical Performance (latency)
   └─ Methodology (baseline + assumptions disclosure)

4. OUTPUT
